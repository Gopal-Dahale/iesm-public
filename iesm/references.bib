	abstract = {The amidogen radical abstracts the hydrogen from nitric acid through a proton coupled electron transfer mechanism rather than by an hydrogen atom transfer process.
          , 
            The gas-phase reaction of nitric acid with the amidogen radical under atmospheric conditions has been investigated using quantum mechanical (QCISD and CCSD(T)) and DFT (B3LYP, BH\&HLYP, M05, M05-2X, and M06-2X) calculations with the 6-311+G(2df,2p), aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVQZ and extrapolation to the CBS basis sets. The reaction begins with the barrierless formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex, which can undergo two different reaction pathways, in addition to the decomposition back to the reactants. The lowest energy barrier pathway involves a proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanism, whereas the highest energy barrier pathway takes place through a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. The performance of the different DFT functionals in predicting both the geometries and relative energies of the stationary points investigated has been analyzed.},

	abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) has become ubiquitous for chemical applications in research and in education. The exact functional at the foundation of DFT is unfortunately unknown, and issues arise when choosing an approximation for a specific application. With this tutorial review, we tackle the selection problem and many related ones, such as the choices of a basis set and of an integration grid, that are often overlooked by occasional practitioners and by more experienced users as well. We offer a practical approach in the form of a commented notebook containing 12 experiences that can be run on a simple computer in just a few hours. We propose this review as a primary source for those who are willing to include DFT in their everyday research or teaching activities in a way that reflects the research advances of the field in the last couple of decades.},
