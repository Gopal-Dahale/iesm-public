# Course Reminders

Course Reminders:

* Exercise 8 interview will be next week (Dec 9) and exercise 9 will not have interviews and will have due date **31. January**
* We only keep the best 8 grades out of the 9 reports : )
* Feel free to contact us via email or forum for questions about Ex8 and Ex9 !


# Exercise 8 Finding transition states
In this set of exercises, we will learn how to traverse the potential energy landscape in interesting directions toward transition states.

# Reaction Mechanisms & Stereochemistry 
* The formation of propylene oxide takes place in a couple of steps
* Nucleophilic substitution occurs, binding O to C, and removing Cl- (leaving group)
* What is the name of such a mechanism and what is the orientation of O with respect to Cl as the ring begins to form?
* What might possible trnasition states look like as the ring begins to form?

* We need to find stationary points, for TS we need the Hessian with exactly one negative eigenvalue.

# Tips
* You do not need to run all notebooks! We provide some data to you (we are the "colleague" in this case) while writing out the code if you're interested.
* Read instructions carefully on how to generate a "guess" transition state
* Calculations may take time, please don't be alarmed!
* Notebooks are named Ex 9 based on past ordering, but this is Ex 8
