- Exercises contribute to 1/3 of final grade

- Submit report 
	- `pdf` document answering the questions completely with relevant results
		- Handwritten portions ok (please verify legibility) 
		- You can type responses in the noto notebook and save as a pdf
	- Due date is usually the next exercise session (check Moodle!) 
	- Interviews during next exercise session
		- Test your understanding and discuss your doubts/questions
	- Detailed feedback via Moodle after the interview
		- No grade, but comments and detailed corrections

# Computer environment
- We will use a virtual environment that you can directly launch from the [exercise website](https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/iesm-public/intro.html)
- Click the rocket button on the top right of the code files and choose JupyterHub to launch [noto.epfl.ch](https://noto.epfl.ch/)
		![](/data/iesm/img_slides/Ex1/notebooks.png)
- On [noto.epfl.ch](https://noto.epfl.ch/) your work will be saved on your EPFL storage
- Make sure to always activate (top right) the `Computational Chemistry` kernel

# Exercise 1 - Tips
**Tips!**

* Start from Section 1.3 - [Working with vectos using Numpy](https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/iesm-public/Exercises/Ex1/Ex1_Numpy.html) to get familiar with Noto environment and Jupyter Notebooks
* How to get the slides:
	* Download from the [exercise page](https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/iesm-public/Exercises/Ex1/IESM_Ex1.html)

	  ![](/data/iesm/img_slides/Ex1/download_button.png){width=30%} \

	* Once you open [Noto](https://noto.epfl.ch/), in the exercise folder
