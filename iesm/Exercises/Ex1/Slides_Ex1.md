- Exercises contribute to 1/3 of final grade

- Submit report 
	- `pdf` document answering the questions completely with relevant results
		- Handwritten portions ok (please verify legibility)
		- We provide report templates on Overleaf and Google Docs 
	- Due date is usually the next exercise session (check Moodle!) 
	- Interviews during next exercise session
		- Test your understanding and discuss your doubts/questions
	- Detailed feedback via Moodle after the interview
		- No grade, but comments and detailed corrections

# Computer environment
- We will use a virtual environment that you can directly launch from the [exercise website](https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/iesm-public/intro.html)
- Click the rocket button on the top right of the code files and choose JupyterHub to launch [noto.epfl.ch](https://noto.epfl.ch/)
		![](/data/iesm/img_slides/Ex1/notebooks.png)
- On [noto.epfl.ch](https://noto.epfl.ch/) your work will be saved on your EPFL storage
- Make sure to always activate (top right) the `Computational Chemistry` kernel

# Jupyter notebooks
- `.iynb` files organized in cells
	- Markdown (text)
	- Code 

- Run a code cell by pressing `Play` button (or `Ctrl`+`Enter`)

# Exercise 1 - Overview
**Linear Algebra in Quantum Mechanics** - [Exercise page](https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/iesm-public/Exercises/Ex1/IESM_Ex1.html)

* Linear Algebra in Quantum Mechanics
* Basic Concepts in Quantum Mechanics
* Working with vectors using Numpy

![](/data/iesm/img_slides/Ex1/ex1_goals.png) \


# Exercise 1 - Tips
**Tips!**

* Start from Section 1.3 - [Working with vectos using Numpy](https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/iesm-public/Exercises/Ex1/Ex1_Numpy.html) to get familiar with Noto environment and Jupyter Notebooks
* How to get the slides:
	* Download from the [exercise page](https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/iesm-public/Exercises/Ex1/IESM_Ex1.html)

	  ![](/data/iesm/img_slides/Ex1/download_button.png){width=30%} \

	* Once you open [Noto](https://noto.epfl.ch/), in the exercise folder

	  ![](/data/iesm/img_slides/Ex1/slides_from_jn.png){width=50%} \

	* Will be uploaded on the [Moodle page](https://moodle.epfl.ch/course/view.php?id=14818)

# Exercise 1 - Tips
* We provide templates for the exercise reports, you can access them from the [exercise page](https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/iesm-public/Exercises/Ex1/IESM_Ex1.html) 

  ![](/data/iesm/img_slides/Ex1/template_button.png){width=30%} \
* The answers can be short, for a full mark we don't expect more than what is explicitly asked
* You can ask for help anytime on the exercises and also the theory!
	* During the exercise session
 	* During the week, on the Moodle Forum (public, so everyone can benefit from the answers and in principle you can help each other!)
  	* At least one of us will be always present at the lectures, you can ask us questions before/after or during the break
 

# Exercise Sessions - Important Information
* The final grade from the exercises will be given by the best 8 out of 9 exercises. Hence in principle, you have a "free" exercise that you can decide to skip
* We will send a schedule for the interviews before each exercise session
* Please let us know in advance if you will not be able to be there for the interview
* In case of overlaps with other courses, we can schedule interviews also outside the exercise hours
* In case you don't show up at the interview and you don't contact us via email to reschedule the interview, the grade for that report will be 0
